Observer Pattern 

whenever something is changed somehwere or we click a button.

Or if any event happens, then all the people who are subscribed to that event

should be updated about the event 

So we should have an Observer which will have multiple observers 

and whenever some state changes in the observer we have to 
update the changes in the observable.
